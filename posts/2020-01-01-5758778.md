Ten full years after that fateful hostage situation that cost him his left leg, the former leader of an FBI Hostage Rescue Team and now a private security consultant, Will Sawyer, travels with his family to exotic Hong Kong to certify the world's tallest skyscraper, the Pearl. However, a sinister conspiracy, and a team of ruthless, blackmailing mercenaries threaten to burn Chinese multi-billionaire Zhao Long Ji's prized possession to a crisp, when they manage to infiltrate the building and start a fire. Now, the city's safest building has trapped Will's family somewhere in the 96th floor, above the raging inferno, and Sawyer, with the police hot on his trail, must summon up the courage to enter the high-rise. But, can he reach his family before the all-consuming fire turns the skyscraper into a massive, 225-storey chimney?::Nick Riganas
